How to watch The Players Championship 2025: Full TV schedule, channels, times, live streams for PGA Tour golf. The 2025 PGA Tour continues its Florida Swing with the 51st edition of The Players Championship, beginning Thursday.

Almost all of the world’s top golfers are at TPC Sawgrass this week for the 2025 Players Championship. The main storyline is around Scottie Scheffler, the only two-time defending champion, who’s seeking a three-peat at the Florida golf tournament. But he’ll face tough competition from a 144-player field, including 48 of the world’s top 50 golfers.

Defending champion Scottie Scheffler will aim for a piece of golfing history this weekend as he goes in search of a third straight win at the Players Championship.

Currently world No. 1, ahead of Rory McIlroy, Scheffler will try to emulate a feat only achieved by the legendary Jack Nicklaus at the par 72 Stadium Course at Sawgrass.

Up for grabs at golf's unofficial fifth Major this weekend at Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida is the biggest purse in golf, with a substantial $25 million prize pool and a tidy $4.5 million for the overall winner.

The Florida Swings continues at the 51st edition of The Players Championship. Scottie Scheffler is the two-time defending champion, but will face stiff competition from some of the world’s best players at TPC Sawgrass.

One year ago, Scheffler added to his legacy as he became the first player to win back-to-back titles at The Players Championship in 50 years. Shooting a final round of 64 that included a hole-out eagle and four birdies in a five-hole stretch, the two-time major champion matched the record for the biggest comeback and the lowest closing round by a winner.

The World No. 1 has yet to win this year, but did finish tied for third at The Genesis Invitational last month and will start as the overwhelming favorite in Florida. Hoping to dethrone Scheffler will be some of the world’s best players, including former champions Rory McIlroy, Jason Day and Justin Thomas.

American Russell Henley will arrive in Florida full of confidence on the back of the biggest win of his career at the Arnold Palmer Invitational, while Collin Morikawa is another player to watch out for after his second-place finish at Bay Hill Golf Course.

Business has picked up significantly on the PGA Tour as the league's best players have taken to TPC Sawgrass for the 2025 Players Championship. Following a tremendous signature event that created a ton of momentum to start the season, the PGA Tour's flagship event is underway in Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida, one month before major championship season begins at the 2025 Masters.

Scottie Scheffler, the two-time reigning champion at The Players, entered as the favorite to become the first golfer in history to three-peat this tournament. Scheffler has not been playing his best golf to start 2025, but there have been signs of life lately. Rory McIlroy sits just behind Scheffler seeking his second win of the young season coming off a victory five weeks ago, while Collin Morikawa is fourth on the oddsboard after falling one stroke shy of a huge win at the Arnold Palmer Invitational.

Between them is Ludvig Åberg. Similarly a winner already in 2025, the 25-year-old seeks to continue his tremendous play ahead of a trek to Augusta National where he surprised with a second-place finish just a year ago. Rounding out the top six are Xander Schauffele, who has struggled tremendously to start 2025, and Justin Thomas, whose improved game usually gets knocked down a peg when faced with tougher courses.

There was hope that Tiger Woods would suit up for The Players; however, not only did he previously choose not to play in the tournament, the 15-time major champion announced Tuesday that surgery for a ruptured Achilles will keep him out of action indefinitely.

While attending The Players is a dream for many, simply being able to watch the event live from home or the office is an incredible treat each year, and we here at CBS Sports are thrilled to bring you wall-to-wall action throughout the week. Enough talking about it. Here's how you can watch as much of the 2025 Players Championship as possible from Thursday through Sunday.dfghfdghfdfghdfg
